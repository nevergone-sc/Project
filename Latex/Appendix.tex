\chapter{User Manual}
To start a protocol using this application involves 3 basic steps - (1) user chooses a specific protocol role. (2) user inputs the information related to the selected protocol role. (3) user starts the protocol. Below is a snapshot of current GUI of the application, it basically consists of 4 main panels:

\caption{GUI Overview}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Protocol Entity}\\
It is on the very top. It provides 4 roles (as mentioned above) to be chosen for the user. Because every device runs this protocol must be one of those four roles, it is essential that user specifies a role in this panel before start running the protocol.
\item \textbf{Entity Identity}\\
It locates on the left. Here user specifies the information about the host device and the destination device, such like IDs, and IP addresses.
\item \textbf{File Paths}\\
It locates on the right. Here user manages all the disk files that are related to the running of the protocol. Presumably, many important information like public keys, private keys and messages are all files in the device's disk, user has to specify those files' paths before running the protocol.
\item \textbf{Console}\\
It is at the bottom. Here provides buttons for user to start and stop the protocol, and it displays information about the running protocol in a information board.
\end{itemize}

\section{Run Submit Protocol}
It requires at least 2 devices to run this protocol, we call them $ D_0 $ and $ D_1 $. Assume $ D_0 $ is entity Alice, who possesses a message and wants to send it to Bob. Assume $ D_1 $ is entity Courier, who is able to carry the message and transmit it to Bob. To run the protocol successfully, it should be done by the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $ D_0 $ starts the application.

\item $ D_0 $ user selects ``DataCreator" in the Protocol Entity panel.

\item $ D_0 $ user specifies the entity ID, local address and listening port (9888 by default) by filling the corresponding textfields in Entity Identity panel.

\item $ D_0 $ user adds destination entity's public key into its public key list.\\
There are two ways to add an new entry to the public key repository:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item Adding through application: input the ID of the public key holder and the path of public key file by filling the textfields in the Public Key panel. Then click Add button. The (ID, path) pair will then appear in the public key list. This effect is temporary, the pair will disappear in the next launch.
 \item Adding through configuration file: by default, when application is launched, it will import all (ID, path) pairs from a file named PublicKeys in the current directory. User can appending a new line to PublicKeys file to add a new pair. The format is ID;Path, e.g. ``Alice;/publickeys/alice.pk". This effect will take place since next launch of the application.
 \end{enumerate}

\item $ D_0 $ user specifies its private key by filling the textfield with the private key file.

\item $ D_0 $ user specifies recipient entity's ID by filling the textfield in the Data to Send panel.

\item $ D_0 $ user specifies the file that contains the message needs to be sent by filling the file path in the corresponding textfield.

\item $ D_0 $ user click Start button in the Console panel. The running progress of the protocol will be displayed in the information board in the Console panel.

\item $ D_1 $ starts the application.

\item $ D_1 $ user selects ``CourierReceiver" in the Protocol Entity panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user specifies its own entity ID by filling the textfield in Entitiy Identity panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user specifies the ID of the entity he wants to contact (here $ D_0 $'s ID), together with its address and port number by filling corresponding textfields in the rest of Entity Identity panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user add the public key of the entity he wants to contact into the public key list. The way of doing that has been introduced in step 4.

\item $ D_1 $ user click the Start button in the Console panel. The running progress of the protocol will be displayed in the information board in the Console panel.
\end{enumerate}
Below figures show snapshot of two applications successfully running Submit Protocol. After application consoles on both devices pops ``process finish" successfully, the message of $ D_0 $ has been submitted to the $ D_1 $, and is stored in the file named by the message recipient's ID. If $ D_1 $ gathers messages from multiple devices, all messages to the same recipient will be accumulated in the same file.

\section{Run Transmit Protocol}
It requires at least 2 devices to run this protocol, we call them $ D_1 $ and $ D_2 $. Assume $ D_1 $ is entity Courier, who possesses an encrypted message from Alice and wants to send it to Bob. Assume $ D_2 $ is entity Bob, who waits to receive message from Alice. The running procedure of Transmit Protocol is:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $ D_2 $ starts the application.

\item $ D_2 $ user selects ``DataReceiver" in the Protocol Entity panel.

\item $ D_2 $ user specifies the entity ID, local address and listening port (8888 by default) by filling the corresponding textfields in Entity Identity panel.

\item $ D_2 $ user adds destination entity's public key into its public key list. The way of doing that has been introduced in the step 4 of running Submit Protocol.

\item $ D_2 $ user specifies its private key by filling the textfield with the private key file.

\item $ D_2 $ user click Start button in the Console panel. The running progress of the protocol will be displayed in the information board in the Console panel.

\item $ D_1 $ starts the application.

\item $ D_1 $ user selects ``CourierSender" in the Protocol Entity panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user specifies its own entity ID by filling the textfield in Entitiy Identity panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user specifies the ID of the entity he wants to contact (here $ D_2 $'s ID), together with its address and port number by filling corresponding textfields in the rest of Entity Identity panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user add the public key of the entity he wants to contact into the public key list. The way of doing that has been introduced in step 4.

\item $ D_1 $ user specifies the file that contains the data needs to be sent, by filling the file path in the corresponding textfield in Data to Send panel.

\item $ D_1 $ user click the Start button in the Console panel. The running progress of the protocol will be displayed in the information board in the Console panel.
\end{enumerate}
Below figures show snapshot of two applications successfully running Transmit Protocol. After application consoles on both devices pops ``process finish" successfully, the data carried by $ D_1 $ has been transmitted to $ D_2 $. If the authenticity of the data is successfully verified, $ D_2 $ will print the message content out in the information board. If the data contains messages from multiple senders, they will be verified and printed one by one so that user knows which messages have been discarded.
